# Credit card fraud detection - imbalanced classification
* Created models to detect credit card fraud by developing 2 approaches that addresses the issues of imbalanced data classification
* Rebalanced the dataset by undersampling the majority class or oversampling the minority class
* Tested and evaluated multiple under/over-sampling techniques, combined with classification algorithms
* Attacked the imbalance issue by implementing threshold-moving technique
